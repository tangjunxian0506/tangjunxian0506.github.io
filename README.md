# Student Website Assignment (Quarto + GitHub Pages)

This repository contains a simple personal website built using **Quarto** and **GitHub Pages**.

## What You Need to Do
1. Edit the text in each `.qmd` file
2. Change the site title in `_quarto.yml`
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub

Your website will be published automatically after each push to `main`.

## Where to find your site URL
GitHub → **Settings** → **Pages** (or the **Deployments** / **Environments** panel if enabled by your instructor).

## Troubleshooting
- If the site does not build, open **Actions** and click the most recent workflow run to see the error log.
- Make sure you did not delete `_quarto.yml`.
