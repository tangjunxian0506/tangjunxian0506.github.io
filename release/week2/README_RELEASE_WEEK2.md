# Week 2 Release (Instructor)

This folder simulates content that is *present in the repository* but can be kept "hidden"
from students until you tell them to switch branches.

Recommended approach:
- Keep `main` minimal for Week 1.
- Create a branch like `week2` that adds an `assignments/` folder.
- When ready, tell students: `git checkout week2` (or merge week2 into main).

This repository includes a sample `release/week2/assignments/` directory you can move into place.
