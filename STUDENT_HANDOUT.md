# Student Website Assignment — Quick Start

## Goal
Create and publish a simple personal website using **Quarto** and **GitHub Pages**.

## Files you will edit
- `index.qmd` (Home)
- `about.qmd` (About)
- `project.qmd` (Project)
- `_quarto.yml` (Site title and navigation)

## Steps
1. Open each `.qmd` file and replace placeholder text with your own.
2. Open `_quarto.yml` and set `website: title:` to your name.
3. Commit and push to GitHub.

## How to check your site
1. Go to **Actions** and confirm workflows are green (successful).
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** and look for your site URL.
   - If you do not see Pages, your instructor may have enabled the deployment environment view instead.

## Common mistakes
- Deleting `_quarto.yml`
- Renaming files without updating the navbar in `_quarto.yml`
- Pushing to a branch other than `main`

## Getting help
- Include a screenshot of the error from **Actions → workflow run → logs**.
